> This repo has been used as an interim release archive from [the webui repo](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-webui) to [the core monorepo](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai).
> Now we have migrated to use the GitHub release tarball directly from the webui repo, so this interim repo is no longer required.

## Ready-to-use code repository

This repository is intended to provide [WebUI](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-webui) code to be ready to use without any prior work. The code requires a complicated compilation path to use it. This repository simplifies the process, providing already prepared code.
